# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data. The complete project can be found [here.](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jasmeer.sangha#!/)
## Who are our customers?
### The Locals
The first slide focuses on subscribers, individuals that have committed to yearly payments to use bicycles. The majority of subscribers use the bikes during rush hour and have ages that range between 20 and 40 years old. We can postulate that these are all local working individulas trying to avoid rushour traffic in New York City.

### The Tourists
The second group are customers, individuals that have single ride or day passes. The customers skew younger, 20 to 30 years old, and the majority are riding during the dalight hours, 11am-7pm. We can assume these are tourists going sight-seeing in New York City.
