# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data. The complete project can be found [here.](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jasmeer.sangha#!/)
## Who are our customers?
### The Locals
The first slide focuses on subscribers, individuals that have committed to yearly payments to use bicycles. The majority of subscribers use the bikes during rush hour and have ages that range between 20 and 40 years old. We can postulate that these are all local working individulas trying to avoid rushour traffic in New York City.

### The Tourists
The second group are customers, individuals that have single ride or day passes. The customers skew younger, 20 to 30 years old, and the majority are riding during the dalight hours, 11am-7pm. We can assume these are tourists going sight-seeing in New York City.

## What points to Des Moines beinga suitable location?
### New York City Stats
New York City, particularly Manhattan, has a population with an average age ranging between 22 and 37, matching up with the most frequent users of CitiBike bicycles. The pie chart shows a break down of the number of cars per household, the importance will be discussed later. Finally, New York has temperatures suitable for bicycles approximatley  months of the year, though a high precipitation average.

### Des Moines
Des Moines also boasts a similar age range and car to household ratio. Both of these demographic comparisons suggest Des Moines will see similar success rates, when scaled appropriately for population size, seen in New York. Des Moines also has similar temperature patterns and actually less precipitation in the colder months, potentially allowing for higher customer usage rates in the cooler months compared to New York City.

## Who should we market to?
If CitiBike were to choose to expand to Des Moines, there are three groups we should consider marketing towards:
1. Commuters with lower than average commutes, <20 mins, are more likely to be in range of their work places to even consider biking to work. This group account for over half of Des Moines populaiton so any significant percentage of converts will be good progress for the company.
2. The pie charts show the types of ways people in Des Moines commute to work. Its clear that biking is far and away the least popular choice. By giving individuals in the area a choice to bike, we can eat into the percentages of walkers, single drivers and those taking public transport.
3. New York City statistics showed us that people from the age of 20-40 were th most frequent riders. We would be remiss if we did not try and market towards the same demographic as they are a large portion of Des Moines population as well.
